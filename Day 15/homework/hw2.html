        <h1>Mona Lisa</h1>
        <h3>main info</h3>
        <p>The woman behind the Mona Lisa's subject is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo. Lisa was born on June 15, 1479, in Florence, Italy, into a wealthy family. She married Francesco at the age of 16, and they had five children together.The painting was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic.</p>
