    <h3>in this round we only hear Till sing for two different reasons, first is him being one of the main characters and the other is that the song him and acron prepared wasnt the one he started singing. that left the other contestant confused and terrified since that would mean hed loose, not knowing lyrics of the song. The song Till sang was one he wrote for someone as a confession</h3>
