  <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br>were current, if not more so, 
  in the company I joined. I <br>honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>

  <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br> 
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
  for <br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
  The next 12 <br>weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
  the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

  <h1>The team was very <br>supportive and kept me <br> motivated</h1>

  <p>“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work <br>as a mobile engineer 
  for a big <br>company. This was one of the best <br> investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

    <h1>Such a life-changing <br> experience. Highly <br>recommended!</h1>
  
    <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve <br> never written a line of code. I needed <br> some structure from 
    professionals <br>who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to <br> enroll by a former 
    student of theirs <br> who can only say wonderful things <br> about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff 
    did not <br> disappoint. They were very hands-on <br>and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
    project, in <br>, was outstanding. It took <br>my learning to the next level in a way <br> that no tutorial 
    could ever have. In <br>fact, I’ve often referred to it during <br> interviews as an example of my <br> developent 
    experience. It certainly <br>helped me land a job as a full-stack <br> developer after receiving multiple <br> offers. 
    100% recommend! ”</p>

  <h1>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp <br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from <br>their experiences was easy.</h1>

  <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the <br> personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
