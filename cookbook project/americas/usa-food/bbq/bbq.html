                <h1>Barbecue (BBQ) is an essential part of American culinary culture, deeply rooted in tradition and regional diversity. Originating from indigenous and early colonial cooking methods, American BBQ evolved as different regions developed their own signature styles. The slow-cooking process, typically over wood or charcoal, infuses the meat with deep, smoky flavors.
                From Texas-style brisket, which features a simple salt-and-pepper rub and long smoking times, to the sweet and tangy ribs of Kansas City, the variations in BBQ reflect local tastes and history. The Carolinas are famous for their vinegar-based pulled pork, while Memphis is known for dry-rubbed ribs. No matter the region, American BBQ is all about patience, rich flavors, and a love for the craft.

                <h1>How to Make Classic American BBQ Ribs</h1>
                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 racks of pork ribs</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp black pepper</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
                    <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 cup BBQ sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            
                <h3>1. Prepare the Ribs:</h3>
                <p>Remove the membrane from the back of the ribs for better texture. Pat dry with paper towels.</p>
            
                <h3>2. Make the Dry Rub:</h3>
                <p>In a bowl, mix brown sugar, salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Rub the mixture generously onto both sides of the ribs.</p>
            
                <h3>3. Preheat the Grill or Oven:</h3>
                <p>If using a grill, set it for **low and slow cooking** at 225°F (107°C). If using an oven, preheat to 275°F (135°C).</p>
            
                <h3>4. Slow Cook the Ribs:</h3>
                <p>Place the ribs on the grill (or a baking sheet if using the oven). Cook for about **2.5 to 3 hours**, occasionally brushing with a mix of apple cider vinegar and olive oil to keep them moist.</p>
            
                <h3>5. Add the BBQ Sauce:</h3>
                <p>Brush the ribs generously with BBQ sauce during the last **30 minutes** of cooking, letting the sauce caramelize.</p>
            
                <h3>6. Serve and Enjoy:</h3>
                <p>Let the ribs rest for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with extra BBQ sauce and classic sides like coleslaw or cornbread.</p>
