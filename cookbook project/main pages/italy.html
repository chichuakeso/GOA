        <p class="italyyap">Italian cuisine is known for its simplicity, using fresh, high-quality ingredients to create flavorful and comforting dishes. Pasta, pizza, and risotto are iconic staples, with regional specialties such as Neapolitan pizza, Tuscan ribollita, and Sicilian cannoli showcasing the country's culinary diversity. Olive oil, tomatoes, and fresh herbs like basil and oregano are essential components, often paired with world-famous cheeses like Parmigiano-Reggiano and mozzarella.</p>
