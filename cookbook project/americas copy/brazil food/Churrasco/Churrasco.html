                <h1>Churrasco is Brazil’s famous barbecue tradition, consisting of grilled meats seasoned simply with salt and cooked over an open flame. It originated with the Gauchos (cowboys) of southern Brazil in the 19th century, who slow-roasted meat over wood fires. Today, churrasco is a staple at Brazilian steakhouses and family gatherings, often served with chimichurri, farofa, and grilled vegetables.</h1>

                <h1>How to Make Brazilian Churrasco</h1>

                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 lbs (900g) picanha (top sirloin cap) or ribeye</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp coarse sea salt (or rock salt)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil (optional)</li>
                    <li>1 tsp black pepper (optional)</li>
                    <li>Wood or charcoal for grilling</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            
                <h3>1. Prepare the Meat:</h3>
                <p>Slice the picanha into thick steaks or leave it whole. If using whole picanha, score the fat cap slightly.</p>
            
                <h3>2. Season Simply:</h3>
                <p>Sprinkle **coarse salt** evenly over the meat. Do not rub it in; the salt will melt into the meat as it cooks.</p>
            
                <h3>3. Prepare the Grill:</h3>
                <p>Preheat a charcoal or wood-fired grill to **medium-high heat**. If using skewers, fold the picanha into a "C" shape and skewer it.</p>
            
                <h3>4. Grill the Meat:</h3>
                <p>Place the meat on the grill, **fat side up**. Cook for about **4-5 minutes per side** for medium-rare, flipping once.</p>
            
                <h3>5. Let It Rest:</h3>
                <p>Remove from the grill and let the meat rest for 5 minutes to retain juices.</p>
            
                <h3>6. Slice and Serve:</h3>
                <p>Slice thinly against the grain and serve with **chimichurri, farofa, or grilled vegetables**.</p>
