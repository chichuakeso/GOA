                <h1>American burgers trace their origins to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, evolving from German immigrants’ Hamburg-style beef patties. The modern hamburger, served in a bun, is often credited to various inventors, including Louis Lassen of Louis’ Lunch in Connecticut (1900) and the Menches brothers in New York. Burgers gained widespread popularity with the rise of fast food in the mid-20th century, led by chains like White Castle (1921) and McDonald's (1940). Today, American burgers are a global icon, known for their variety, from classic cheeseburgers to gourmet and regional specialties.</h1>

                <h1>How to Make a Classic American Burger</h1>

                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 lb (450g) ground beef (80/20 fat ratio for juiciness)</li>
                    <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
                    <li>4 burger buns</li>
                    <li>4 slices of cheese (optional, e.g., American or cheddar)</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp butter (for toasting buns)</li>
                    <li>Lettuce, tomato slices, onion rings, pickles (optional)</li>
                    <li>Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise (optional)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Instructions:</h2>

                <h3>1. Form the Patties:</h3>
                <p>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions. Gently shape each portion into a patty about ¾ inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center with your thumb to prevent puffing during cooking. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</p>

                <h3>2. Preheat the Grill or Pan:</h3>
                <p>Heat a grill or skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly oil the surface to prevent sticking.</p>

                <h3>3. Cook the Patties:</h3>
                <p>Place the patties on the grill or pan. Cook for about <strong>3-4 minutes per side</strong> for medium doneness. Avoid pressing the patties down to keep the juices inside.</p>

                <h3>4. Melt the Cheese (Optional):</h3>
                <p>In the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty. Cover the pan or close the grill lid to help it melt.</p>

                <h3>5. Toast the Buns:</h3>
                <p>Spread butter on the cut sides of the buns. Toast them on the grill or pan for <strong>30 seconds to 1 minute</strong> until golden brown.</p>

                <h3>6. Assemble the Burger:</h3>
                <p>Place the cooked patty on the bottom bun. Add toppings like lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles. Spread your favorite condiments on the top bun.</p>

                <h3>7. Serve and Enjoy:</h3>
                <p>Place the top bun on the burger and serve immediately with fries or a side of your choice.</p>
