                <h1>Quinoa, an ancient seed cultivated in South America for thousands of years, is a highly nutritious ingredient packed with protein, fiber, and essential amino acids. It has become a staple in modern healthy eating due to its light, nutty flavor and versatility.
                    One of the most delightful variations is Quinoa & Cranberry Salad, which combines the wholesome goodness of quinoa with the tart sweetness of dried cranberries. This salad is perfect as a light meal, side dish, or even a festive holiday addition. The combination of textures—fluffy quinoa, chewy cranberries, crunchy nuts, and crisp vegetables—creates a refreshing and satisfying dish.</h1>

                <h1>How to Make Quinoa & Cranberry Salad</h1>

                <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
                    <li>2 cups water or vegetable broth</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup dried cranberries</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup chopped almonds or walnuts</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup diced cucumber</li>
                    <li>1/4 red onion (finely chopped)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley (chopped)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
                    <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
                    <li>1 tsp honey or maple syrup</li>
                    <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            
                <h3>1. Cook the Quinoa:</h3>
                <p>Rinse the quinoa under cold water to remove bitterness. In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water or vegetable broth to a boil. Add the quinoa, reduce heat, cover, and simmer for about <strong>15 minutes</strong> until water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it cool.</p>
            
                <h3>2. Prepare the Ingredients:</h3>
                <p>While the quinoa cools, chop the cucumber, red onion, and parsley. Toast the nuts in a dry pan over medium heat for 2-3 minutes until lightly golden.</p>
            
                <h3>3. Make the Dressing:</h3>
                <p>In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, honey (or maple syrup), salt, and black pepper.</p>
            
                <h3>4. Assemble the Salad:</h3>
                <p>In a large bowl, combine the cooled quinoa, cranberries, toasted nuts, chopped vegetables, and crumbled feta (if using). Pour the dressing over the salad and toss gently to combine.</p>
            
                <h3>5. Serve and Enjoy:</h3>
                <p>Let the salad sit for a few minutes to absorb the flavors. Serve chilled or at room temperature as a nutritious meal or side dish.</p>
